Ridiculously Simple File System Implementation - Gavin Andres
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING: To test the RSFS, run
    make all
    ./app
This will run tests for normal use, normal concurrent use, and edge cases of
creating too many files, and writing too many bytes to files

CHANGES:
- def.h: variables for concurrency added to inode struct
- api.c: compelete missing functions per assignment spec, as well as a slight
  change to RSFS_create, fixing a problem where creating more than 8 files
  would result in a directory entry being made with inode number -1
- application.c: additional test cases added
